# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking


In this project, we fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track multiple vehicles over time. We will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, load precomputed detection result and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.




## Overview

This writeup documents the major workflow of implementing this project, including

* Tracking, implement a kalman filter to track a single object
* Track management, initialize, update and delete tracks to manage tracking for multiple objects
* Data association,  associate multiple measurements to multiple tracks
* Camera sensor fusion, on the basis of above operation, we add camera measurement fusion
* Evaluate, evaluate tracking result against groud truth
* Reflection
